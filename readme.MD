# Decentralized Application
This is a repository built while writing an article on my blog on Medium.  

The article for this branch can be found [here](https://itnext.io/building-a-decentralized-application-with-bep-20-contract-in-solidity-d2c066447aa6)  
The repository showcases how a DApp can look like.  

In the Repository you will find a custom built BEP-20 Smart contract.
